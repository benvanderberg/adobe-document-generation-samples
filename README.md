# adobe-document-generation-samples
In this repo, there are a set of documents that can be used to work with Adobe Document Generation API. Each sample is in a folder which contain a data file in the /data folder, a template in the /template folder.

To try any of the samples, you must do the following:
1. Install by running ```npm install``` in the root of the folder.
2. Copy your **pdfservices-api-credentials.json** file and **private.key** from your Adobe PDF Services sample. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/dc-integration-creation-app-cdn/main.html).
3. In the command line, you can make a call to run any of the samples.

```
node Agreement
```

The output file will be in the respective output folder for that sample demo.
